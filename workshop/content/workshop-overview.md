The [principle of least privilege]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege))
is widely recognized as an important design consideration in enhancing the protection of critical systems from faults and malicious behavior. It suggests that every component must be able to access **only** the information and resources that are necessary for its legitimate purpose.
